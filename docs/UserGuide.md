SETA (Software Engineering for Teaching Assistants) is a **desktop application for CS2103T Teaching Assistants** to 
track 
students’ and 
tutorials’ details,
and
questions asked by students. SETA is optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#command-line-interface-cli) while still having the
benefits of a [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#graphical-user-interface-gui). If you can type fast, SETA enables you to track your 
students, 
manage your
tutorials and note-down questions more effectively than traditional GUI apps.

The purpose of this guide is to inform you what features are available in SETA, and how to use them to solve your needs
as a CS2103T TA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or above
   installed on your Computer. If you have issues doing so, refer to the troubleshooting
   guide [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-0DB9580B-1ACA-4C13-8A83-9780BEDF30BB)
   .

2. Download the latest `SETA.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SETA.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the
   app contains some sample data.
   <br><br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
   <br><br>
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`liststu`** and pressing Enter will
   list all the students in the 'Student' column.<br>

Some example commands you can try:

* **`addstu`**`n/John Lim Jun Jie h/@johnlimjj e/johnlim@example.com`: Adds a student named `John Lim Jun Jie` to the
  student list.

* **`deletestu`**`3`: Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

* **`exit`**: Exits the app.

You can refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

SETA contains features that allow you to manage 3 things:

1. [Students](#students)
2. [Questions](#questions)
3. [Tutorials](#tutorials)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addstu n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter that can be used as `addstu n/John Lim`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [h/TELEGRAM_HANDLE]` can be used as `n/John Lim h/@johnlim` or as `n/John Lim`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `h/@johnlim h/@johnlimjj`, only `h/@johnlimjj` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `liststu` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `liststu 123`, it will be interpreted as `liststu`.

* `INDEX`, a commonly used parameter in our commands, must be a positive non-zero integer e.g. 1, 2, 3,... and less than
  the number of items in its respective list e.g. for `markq`, `INDEX` must be less than the number of questions in the question
  list.

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the respective displayed list.

</div>

### Students

The features under the student category allow you to keep track of and manage the students under you. You can see your
student's details, such as their names, telegram handles, and email. The latter two aid you in contacting any students
if necessary. You can also track each student's attendance and responses (the number of messages he or she has sent on
Zoom) to record their participation.

![ExitButton](images/ug-screenshots/exit.png)

### JSON file

A [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (JavaScript Object Notation) file is a file with an open standard file format and a data interchange format. 
Its purpose is to use human-readable text to store and transmit data objects. Such a file is used in SETA to store 
information for the student, question and tutorial list.

### Hard Disk

A [hard disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) (or hard disk drive) is a data storage device that 
stores and retrieves digital data. This is found in your device that is running SETA.
